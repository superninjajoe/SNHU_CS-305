# SNHU_CS-305

-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is an accounting firm. They develop individual financial plans for their customers They requested our assistance with ensuring their public web app was secure when working with personal and financial data of their customers.

-What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I did enjoy running the status testing and identifying their vulnerabilities. I liked being able to search for false positives and checking the significant of the vulnerability. Secure coding is important to prevent data leaks and theft. It protect the companies integrity and reliability. It ensure the public trust the company and their ethics. 

-What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The dependency check was helpful. It allowed me to save time to automatically detect vulnerabilities. 

-How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Adding pen testing to the web service would not hurt. It would provide a real world assessment of their vulnerabilities instead of running test through a data base.

-How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ran the dependency check multiple times to ensure everything was running correctly. I would also manually check the code and ensure everything look correct. 

-What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used SNHU discord channel to look for other students who ran into the same types of issues as I did. Interet searchs were a hit or miss. I found finding  a community going through the same challenges as me was the best thing to do.

-Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I plan on utilizing my github to show examples of my work. I would like to work on more private project but currently my schedule is full to allow me to do that. Showing these project will show I know how to present my findings to any clients.
